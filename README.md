# Java TP Projects

This repository contains a collection of Java projects completed during practical sessions with Madame Amina Jarraya. These projects cover various topics in Java development, including Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), database management, IoC (Inversion of Control), Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP), and design principles.

## Project List

### 1. Basic Java and OOP Concepts
- **`COMPTEUR`**: A counter application demonstrating basic OOP principles.
- **`COMPTEURsansAspect`** and **`tp_sansaspect`**: Variations on the counter application without AOP integration.

### 2. Design Patterns and Principles
- **`SOLID`**: Examples illustrating SOLID principles in software design.
- **`Refactoring_TP1_GL`**: Refactoring exercises to improve code quality and readability.

### 3. Database Management with JDBC and Hibernate
- **`jdbcDemo`**: A JDBC-based project for understanding database connectivity in Java.
- **`hibernate`**: Basic Hibernate examples demonstrating ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) concepts.
- **`HibernateAnnotations`** and **`HibernateXML`**: Hibernate examples using annotations and XML-based configurations.
- **`InheritanceHierarchyXML`**: Demonstrates inheritance mapping with XML configurations in Hibernate.

### 4. Maven Projects
- **`maven`, `MavenOneToManyXML`, `mavenTest`**: Projects illustrating dependency management and project structure with Maven.

### 5. Inversion of Control (IoC) and Dependency Injection
- **`IoCproject`**: A project demonstrating IoC principles, focusing on dependency injection.

### 6. Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)
- **`TP_AVECASPECT`**: A project applying AOP concepts, specifically using aspects to separate cross-cutting concerns.
- **`CentreDonnees2Tiers`**: A two-tier data center application, potentially integrating AOP.

### 7. Stock Management Systems
- **`GestionDeStocks`**: A stock management system with basic inventory tracking.

## Getting Started

Each project folder contains specific code files, and some projects may have a dedicated `README.md` or configuration files like `pom.xml` for Maven-based projects.

### Prerequisites

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**
- **Maven** (for Maven projects)
- **MySQL** or another SQL database (for database-related projects)

### Running the Projects

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/eya-methnani/software-reengineering-COURSE.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the desired project folder.
3. Build and run the project using your preferred IDE (e.g., Eclipse) or command line.

### Notes

- Some projects may require a specific setup or configuration (e.g., database credentials).
- For projects involving Hibernate, ensure that database tables are created as needed.
